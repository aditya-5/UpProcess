The app uProcess is a solution with the target audience as commercial organizations. At at the most basic level, the app allows the HR Department or manager in general to assign work to the company's employees and keep a tally of their attendance. It can also be thought of a simple attendance + to-do list app merged into one with added functionality.

The flagship feature of the application is that it provides the administrator with a list of employees with ones at the top being the most deserving of a promotion. This would depend on a number of factors. A few of them are - 

1. a) The attendance of an employee 
   b) The leaves taken. It will differ from the attendance aspect.
	  For this, the employee will have to login to his dashboard and mark attendance within a specific time period as specified by the employer. For example - 10 AM - 5PM

2. The number of tasks completed
	a) The formal tasks (assigned by the boss) to the employee will have to be submitted for approval on a per day basis (big projects will have to be broken down into sub-tasks). Not being able to do so will result in the task being marked unachieved automatically after 5 PM. A SIGNED IN session will allow the user to work overtime and Submit tasks for approval even after 5 PM on the same day. A SESSION END would lead to marking all the non-submitted tasks UNACHIEVED. 
	b) The informal tasks (added by the employee himself) will not count towards the factors.
	c) Time factor will also be taken into consideration. How early or how late a task has been achieved will yield different points. 
	d) Tasks can also be assigned a level. Difficult tasks would yield more points on the backend whereas easy tasks would yield less points. (to eradicate the bias between someone achieving easy tasks and someone not being able to achieve difficult tasks). A simple analogy would be - A difficult task could yield 5 points whereas a simple task could yield 1-2 points. 

	
Task status and roadmap - 
	Pending (blue) -> Submitted (yellow) -> Done (green)		  
	Pending (blue) -> Unachieved (red)	

Being the first version, only these arguments have been taken into consideration. We are looking forward to forming more argumens and making it an even more bias free app to be used.
